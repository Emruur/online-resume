    details: |
      I'm a programmer who's interested in using code to simulate natural
      systems and observe their behavior based on physical laws. Although
      I specialize in developing full-stack web applications, 
      I can apply my skills to other areas like mobile and desktop development. I'm particularly good at learning new skills and putting them into practice.
